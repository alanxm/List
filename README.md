## Artificial Intelligence

When using cloud-based AI services, the data you input is often collected and stored by the service provider. This may include not only the content of your requests but also metadata, such as timestamps or IP addresses. Third-party servers may grant access to your data to their employees, partners, or even other users, depending on their privacy policies. Data may be used for various purposes, including model training, research, or even marketing activities. Your requests to a third-party AI service may be tied to your user information and payment details, linking your data to your identity.

Plus, Adobe's [data collection via Creative Cloud](https://tosdr.org/en/service/417) and [trackers](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.adobe.psmobile/latest/) further amplifies privacy concerns. They also may be [using users&#39; work to train their AIs](https://mastodon.art/@Krita/109632425661190494), potentially causing intellectual property problems.

Also, [it is tied](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/terms) to the [Microsoft privacy terms](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) which are a privacy nightmare.
